    """Generator function that chunks bytes.

    Chunking is the process of taking the input `content_bytes` and breaking it up into a sequence of smaller bytes
        called "chunks".
    The sizes of each chunk are <= `chunk_size`.

    Example:
        content_bytes = b"1234567890123"
        chunk_size = 4
        yields:
            b"1234"
            b"5678"
            b"9012"
            b"3"

    Args:
        content_bytes (bytes): Bytes object with the data to be chunked.
        chunk_size (int): Each individual chunk will be assigned this many bytes maximum.
        bytes_left_in_last_chunk (int): If chunks were created already, `bytes_left_in_last_chunk`
            should be set to the `chunk_size - len(last_chunk)`. This is so the generator's
            first output will be enough bytes to fill that chunk up to `chunk_size`.

    Yields:
        bytes: Chunk of the `content_bytes`. Will have length on the interval (1, `chunk_size`].

    Raises:
        ChunkSizeTooSmallError: If `chunk_size` <= 0
        ValueError: If `bytes_left_in_last_chunk` < 0

    For more on chunking, see the `generate_chunks` method.

    Example:

        start_byte = 1
        end_byte = 2
        returns:

    Args:
        chunks (list[bytes]): Sequential list of bytes objects that represent chunks.
        start_byte (int): The first chunk in the sequence will ignore the bytes before `start_byte`. If 0, all bytes are
            included.
        end_byte (int): The last chunk in the sequence will ignore the bytes at and after `end_byte-1`.
            If None, all bytes are included.

    Notes:
        Bytes are indexed using: chunk[start_byte:end_byte]. That is why `chunk[end_byte]` will not be included in
            `chunk[start_byte:end_byte]`.
        If `len(chunks) == 1`, `start_byte`:`end_byte` will be applied to the same chunk (the first and last one).

    Returns:
        bytes: The chunks joined as one bytes object.
